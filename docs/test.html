    <p>Because SDMX is so generic, the LGA chose a model with three fixed dimensions that always apply to the metrics data that
        drives its reporting tool.</p>
    <p>The LGA’s
        <a href="http://lginformplus.local.gov.uk" target="_blank">LG Inform Plus</a> (formerly esd-toolkit) database holds statistics that are useful to local authorities wishing
        to compare performance and demographics with other authorities and between small areas within their own boundaries.
        Such data allows them to see how effective they are and to target services (such as those to improve public health)
        at relevant people rather than using a scatter-gun approach.</p>
    <p>The data is an amalgamation of public data from disparate national sources supplemented by data gathered locally. A standard
        way of structuring the data is needed to overcome differences in how it is represented by the many source organisations
        (e.g. Office of National Statistics, Department for Education, Public Health England). </p>
    <p>The standard was defined by analysing data from various sources, which is normally presented in spreadsheets or via application
        programming interfaces (APIs). We also looked at the database structure of existing data reporting tools, including
        the Audit Commission’s Value for Money tool.</p>
    <p>In abstract terms, each data point is represented by a value (typically a number or a category) that has a number of
        properties which can be grouped in dimensions. The Statistical Data and Metadata eXchange (SDMX) provides a generic
        standard for exchanging statistical data. Because of a lack of familiarity with SDMX, because others had not used
        it and because it is so generic, we chose a model with three fixed dimensions that always apply to the data. </p>
    <p>
    These dimensions are</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>area,</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>time period, and</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>metric (or indicator) type.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>An individual data item has a precise value for each of these dimensions. For example, a single bicycle theft has a count
        of one with a specific date and time, a point on the map and a metric type denoting bicycle theft. But much data
        is only available at an aggregated level, so data might contain a count of thefts in general within an area (e.g.
        a police neighbourhood) over a time period (e.g. a calendar month).</p>
    <p>The data structure therefore needs to record data at the most detailed level at which it is available and needed. Aggregations
        over longer time periods, bigger areas and broader metric types may be generated on the fly (as in a spreadsheet’s
        pivot table) or aggregated in batch and stored for future reference.</p>
    <p>Let’s look at the three dimensions in more detail.</p>
    <p>Area
        <strong> </strong>has an area type which is a point (as given by
        <em>x</em> and
        <em>y</em> map co-ordinates) or a named polygon. Hierarchies of areas define how data can be aggregated up from small
        to larger areas. Here is an example of a hierarchy of area types used from official statistics in England (from large
        to small).</p>

        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <a href="http://neighbourhoods.esd.org.uk/#?areaType=LLSOA&amp;tab=ViewAreaType" target="_blank">Lower level super output area</a> (LSOA)</p>
        </li>
        <li>

            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Links from the above area types are to the LGA’s Natural Neighbourhoods area type page which shows parent and child area
        types and ‘same as’ relationships for equivalent area type definitions elsewhere. </p>
    <p>Area types can be polyhierarchical, e.g. a district is broken down by both MSOAs and wards, and sometimes the fit of
        areas within their parent is only approximate, in which case a measure of degree of fit can be useful.</p>
    <p>Where data describes an area, care is needed to avoid double counting across overlapping areas, e.g. adding the population
        of a county to that the districts it contains. However, sometimes an area is used as a proxy for the organisation
        governing it. In theses cases data pertaining to the organisations can be added. For example, spending on roads by
        a local authority and spending by the Highways Agency in the same area should be totalled to get overall spending
        on roads.</p>
    <p>Time period
        <strong> </strong>has a time period type such as calendar month, calendar year, financial year, academic year, etc.. Metrics
        values may be aggregated over a time period, e.g. all crimes in a month, or represent a count at a point in time
        that is sampled for each time period, e.g. population for a census year. The former can be aggregated over time,
        e.g. add the crimes in each month to get the year’s crime figures; the latter cannot.</p>
    <p>Metric type is a broad definition of what the statistics define. Hierarchies of metric type can be defined in the same
        way as hierarchies of areas can. For example, crime can be defined from broad to narrow as</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                <a href="http://id.esd.org.uk/metricType/1068" target="_blank">overall crime</a>,</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <a href="http://id.esd.org.uk/metricType/3813" target="_blank">theft crime</a>, and</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <a href="http://id.esd.org.uk/metricType/4536" target="_blank">bicycle theft</a>.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Sometimes metric types break down in multiple ways. For example, employment data can be defined by</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                <a href="http://id.esd.org.uk/circumstanceCollection/Workcontract" target="_blank">employment contract type</a> (part-time, full-time, etc.),</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <a href="http://id.esd.org.uk/circumstanceCollection/WorkingHours" target="_blank">working hours</a> (temporary, permanent, etc.), and</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>employee
                <a href="http://id.esd.org.uk/circumstanceCollection/Gender" target="_blank">gender</a> (female, male, etc.).</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Detailed metric types, such as the
        <a href="http://id.esd.org.uk/metricType/579" target="_blank">number of female part-time employees who are temporary</a>, define figures which can be aggregated to derive different
        summaries according to how metric types are related.</p>
    <p>Relationships between metric types are given by the circumstances they define, such as
        <a href="http://id.esd.org.uk/circumstanceCollection/Workcontract"
            target="_blank">employment contract type</a>,
        <a href="http://id.esd.org.uk/circumstanceCollection/WorkingHours" target="_blank">working hours</a> and
        <a href="http://id.esd.org.uk/circumstanceCollection/Gender" target="_blank">gender</a>, as detailed above. By standardising these in a
        <a href="http://id.esd.org.uk/list/circumstances" target="_blank">circumstance types list</a> according to standard rules for taxonomies, we can relate metrics from different sources
        that use the same breakdowns and hence analyse for patterns in the data.</p>
    <p>The structure described above allows for data items (i.e. metric values) to be queried by</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>area or a group of areas (e.g. all wards in a district),</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>time period or a groups of time periods (e.g. the last twelve months), and</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>metric type or a group of metric types (e.g. all metric types in the dimension defined by the crime types circumstance).</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Separate queries on areas, periods and metric types are provided. As well as raw data values, statistical functions are
        performed (e.g. total, mean, standard deviation thresholds, etc.) for ranges of values, applying rules for what metric
        values can meaningfully be aggregated over time and area.</p>
