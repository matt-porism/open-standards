# 0. What is a standard

The International Standards Organisation ([ISO](https://www.iso.org/)) defines a standard as 'a documented agreement containing technical spdctecifications or other precise criteria to be used consistently as rules, guidelines, or definitions of characteristics to ensure that materials, products, processes and services are fit for their purpose'. Consider if this should be a footnote or a more subtle reference somewhere.

Here we are considering *data *standards which we define as :

An explicitly defined means of expressing data such that it can be exchanged and interpreted consistently by people and machines within and between organisations.

So a standard is for data interchange.  It does not necessarily reflect the way the data is stored in a database for processing by an application.

A standard is documented in human and machine readable formats via:

* Guidance documents

* Schemas that define the data structure with rules on cardinality and encoded lists of values that may be used

* Vocabularies of uniquely identifiable concepts and data items that are maintained elsewhere

The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) expresses standards as "Recommendations" with precise rules expressed as “normative” sections and guidance as “non-normative”.
