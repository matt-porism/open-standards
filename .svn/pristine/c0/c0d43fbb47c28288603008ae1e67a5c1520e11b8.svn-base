# What is a standard?

The International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) defines a standard as 'documents that provide requirements, specifications, guidelines or characteristics that can be used consistently to ensure that materials, products, processes and services are fit for their purpose'.<sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup>

Here we are considering standards for data, which we define as

An explicitly defined means of expressing data such that it can be exchanged and interpreted consistently by people and machines within and between organisations and individuals.

So a standard is for data interchange. It does not necessarily reflect the way the data is stored in a database for processing by an application.

A standard is documented in human and machine readable formats via

* guidance documents,

* schemas that define the data structure with rules on cardinality and encoded lists of values that may be used, and

* taxonomies of uniquely identifiable concepts and data items that are maintained elsewhere.

The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) describes and publishes standards as Recommendations<sup>[2](#footnote2)</sup> with precise rules expressed as ‘normative’ sections and guidance as ‘non-normative’.
